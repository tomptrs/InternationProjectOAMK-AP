# Project Work


## Initiating the project  

Initiating the project is the first step or phase of the project.  The most important milestones here are the acquaintance with the team members and the client and making and presenting the project proposal.  
http://www.spring2innovation.com/2019/04/design-thinking-vs-user-centred-design/

## Assignment 1: The project team 

The client wants to know if the project can go on.  One of the reasons of his decision is to see who the project team is and if they are up to the job.  So present your team 

1. Who is who (picture + name + specialty + country/city)  if you want to you can pick a name for the team 

2. The Belbin roles and the benefits and risks of the constitution (*See next chapter*)

3. Team competences (or the lack of it) and the benefits and risks for the team

**Put all items in a couple of slides or find another creative way to introduce yourselves**

## Belbin roles in the team 

The research of Dr Meredith Belbin, started in the late 1970’s, and led to the development of the ‘Belbin Team Roles’, 9 clusters of behaviour that individuals adopt when participating in a team.  
 
During extensive work at Henley Management College it became clear that teams made up of a balanced mix of the 9 team roles outperformed unbalanced teams.  Subsequent research has also demonstrated that balanced teams consistently outperform other teams where a wide range of complementary behaviours is required.   
 
Today, the Belbin Team Role model is used by over 40% of the top 100 companies in the UK, the United Nations,the World Bank and thousands of organisations throughout the world, to enhance individual and team performance.   
 
The information provided by the Self Perception analysis is useful for:

- Enhancing self awareness and personal effectiveness. - Ensuring managers and organisations have a better      understanding of the natural talents of each    employee. 
- Matching people to specific tasks. 
- Selecting and building effective teams.

 ### Points table 
 
 In this table, work section by section, putting the points you allocated to the various sentences, next to the corresponding letters.  In some sections the same letter appears more than once.  Put the points you allocated next to all of the same corresponding letters i.e. section 4 has A twice so if you choose A then the score given will go against both letter A. 
 
Add up the totals in the end column, reading across the rows.

## Interpreting your Scores

The highest score is your primary Belbin role, and your second highest score is your secondary Belbin role.  
 

According to Belbin, each of the roles have strengths, and ‘allowable weaknesses’.  A brief summary of each of the nine Team Roles follows.

### PLANTS (PL)

Characteristics Plants are innovators and inventors and can be highly creative. They provide the seed and ideas from which major developments spring. Usually they prefer to operate by themselves at some distance from other members of the team, using their imagination and often working in an unorthodox way. They tend to be introverted and react strongly to criticism and praise. Their ideas may often be radical and may lack practical constraint. They are independent, clever and original and may be weak in communicating with other people on a different wave length.

Function The main use of a PL is to generate new proposals and to solve complex problems.  PLs are often needed in the initial stages of a project or when a project is failing to progress. PLs have usually made their mark as founders of companies or as originators of new products.  Too many PLs in one organization, however, may be counter productive as they tend to spend their time reinforcing their own ideas and engaging each other in combat.


### RESOURCE INVESTIGATORS (RI)

Characteristics Resource Investigators are often enthusiastic, quick-off-the-mark extroverts.  They are good at communicating with people both inside and outside the company. They are natural negotiators and are adept at exploring new opportunities and developing contacts.  Although not a great source of original ideas, the RI is effective when it comes to picking up other people's ideas and developing them. As the name suggests, they are skilled at finding out what is available and what can be done. They usually receive a warm reception from others because of their warm outgoing nature.  RIs have relaxed personalities with a strong inquisitive sense and a readiness to see the possibilities in anything new. However, unless they remain stimulated by others, their enthusiasm rapidly fades.

Function RIs are good at exploring and reporting back on ideas, developments or resources outside the group. They are the natural people to set up external contacts and to carry out any subsequent negotiations.  They have an ability to think on their feet and to probe others for information.


### MONITOR EVALUATORS (ME)

Characteristics Monitor Evaluators are serious-minded, prudent individuals with a built-in immunity for being over-enthusiastic. They are slow in making decisions preferring to think things over. Usually they have a high critical thinking ability. They have a good capacity for shrewd judgements that take all factors into account. A good ME is seldom wrong.

Function  MEs are best suited to analysing problems and evaluating ideas and suggestions.  They are very good at weighing up the pro's and con's of options. To many outsiders the ME may appear as dry, boring or even over-critical. Some people are surprised that they become managers. Nevertheless, many MEs occupy strategic posts and thrive in high-level appointments. In some jobs success or failure hinges on a relatively small number of crunch
decisions. This is ideal territory for an ME; for the man who is never wrong is the one who scores in the end.


### CO-ORDINATORS (C0)

Characteristics The distinguishing feature of Co-ordinators is their ability to cause others to work towards shared goals. Mature, trusting and confident, they delegate readily. In interpersonal relations they are quick to spot individual talents and to use them in pursuit of group objectives.  They have a broad and worldly outlook and generally command respect.

Function COs are well placed when put in charge of a team of people with diverse skills and personal characteristics. They perform better in dealing with colleagues of near or equal rank than in directing junior subordinates. Their motto might well be "consultation with control" and they usually believe in tackling problems calmly. In some situations COs are inclined to clash with Shapers due to their contrasting management styles.


### SHAPERS (SH)

Characteristics Shapers are highly motivated people with a lot of nervous energy and a need for achievement. Usually they are aggressive extroverts and possess strong drive. SHs like to challenge others and their concern is to win. They like to lead and to push others into action. If obstacles arise, they find a way round. Headstrong and assertive, they tend to show strong emotional response to any form of disappointment or frustration.  SHs are determined and argumentative and may lack interpersonal sensitivity. Their's is the most competitive role.

Function SHs generally make good managers because they generate action and thrive under pressure. They are excellent at sparking life into a team and are very useful in groups where political complications are apt to slow things down; SHs are inclined to rise above problems of this kind and forge ahead regardless. They are well suited to making necessary changes and do not mind taking unpopular decisions. As the name implies, they try to impose some shape or pattern on group discussion or activities. They are probably the most effective members of a team in guaranteeing positive action.


### IMPLEMENTERS (IMP)

Characteristics Implementers have practical common sense and a good deal of self-control and discipline. They favour hard work and tackle problems in a systematic fashion. On a wider front the IMP is typically a person whose loyalty and interest lie with the Company and who is less concerned with the pursuit of self-interest. However, IMPs may lack spontaneity and show signs of rigidity.

Function IMPS are useful to an organisation because of their reliability and capacity for application. They succeed because they are efficient and because they have a sense of what is feasible and relevant. It is said that many executives only do the jobs they wish to do and neglect those tasks which they find distasteful. By contrast, an IMP will do what needs to be done.  Good IMPS often progress to high management positions by virtue of good organisational skills and competency in tackling necessary tasks.


### TEAM WORKERS (TW)

Characteristics Team Workers are the most supportive members of a team. They are mild, sociable and concerned about others. They have a great capacity for flexibility and adapting to different situations and people. TWs are perceptive and diplomatic. They are good listeners and are generally popular members of a group. They operate with a sensitivity at work, but they may be indecisive in crunch situations.

Function The role of the TW is to prevent interpersonal problems arising within a team and thus allow all team members to contribute effectively. Not liking friction, they will go to great lengths to avoid it. It is not uncommon for TWs to become senior managers especially if line managers are dominated by Shapers. This creates a climate in which the diplomatic and perceptive skills of a TW become real assets, especially under a managerial regime where conflicts are liable to arise or to be artificially suppressed. TW managers are seen as a threat to no one and therefore the most accepted and favoured people to serve under. Team Workers have a lubricating effect on teams. Morale is better and people seem to cooperate better when they are around.


### COMPLETER-FINISHERS (CF)

Characteristics Completer-Finishers have a great capacity for follow through and attention to detail. They are unlikely to start anything that they cannot finish. They are motivated by internal anxiety, yet outwardly they may appear unruffled. Typically, they are introverted and require little in the way of external stimulus or incentive. CFs can be intolerant of those with a casual disposition. They are not often keen on delegating, preferring to tackle all tasks themselves.

Function CFs are invaluable where tasks demand close concentration and a high degree of accuracy. They foster a sense of urgency within a team and are good at meeting schedules. In management they excel by the high standards to which they aspire, and by their concern for precision, attention to detail and follow-through.


### SPECIALISTS (SP) 

Characteristics Specialists are dedicated individuals who pride themselves on acquiring technical skills and specialised knowledge. Their priorities centre on maintaining professional standards and on furthering and defending their own field. While they show great pride in their own subject, they usually lack interest in other people's. Eventually, the SP becomes the expert by sheer commitment along a narrow front. There are few people who have either the singlemindedness or the aptitude to become a first-class SP.

Function SPs have an indispensable part to play in some teams, for they provide the rare skill upon which the firm's service or product is based. As managers, they command support because they know more about their subject than anyone else and can usually be called upon to make decisions based on in-depth experience.


## CONCLUSION

From the above descriptions it can be seen that each Team Role has its own distinctive cluster of behavioural characteristics - with potential strengths and allowable weaknesses.  There are no good or bad Team roles but it is important for each person to know their own Team Roles and those of their colleagues with whom they interact.   It is only by tapping these collective strengths that individuals and teams can realise their full potential - in short "nobody's perfect, but a team can be".

# Assignment 2

 Have a conversation in group about the following questions: 

- 1° What are the different roles/functions in the team?  Which roles are not filled in and which roles are filled in a lot? (E.g. taking notes in meetings, innovator, chairman of meetings, responsible for the code... )

- 2° What does that mean regarding to the team work (with this composition of the team belbin roles, what are the advantages and disadvantages for the group)?

- 3° How can your team benefit from this or what can your team do to lower the risk of inefficient work?

**incorporate your notes in the PPT presentation !** 

# Assignment 3: The aim (goal) of the project

The goal should be defined as a single sentence (or two, tree) and should be expressed clearly!

**Put the goal in slide 1 of the presentation!**

In the next slides the following should be integrated:

- **What is the name of the project** 
- **What is the reason of the project?**

E.g.: the reason of the project: the project starts to fix or improve a problem in the world.

# Assignment 4:

Read your goal (objective) again and see if can make it more concrete by answering the following question?

- what does the client wants to reach with the goal (the answer of this question should give you the exact end result)?

- what requirements does the client have for the project?

**Make a product backlog in jira.ap.be**

# Assignment 5:

read the previous assignment result again and determine what user stories are the most important (so you 'll ve as soon as possible a working prototype)
	
    - brainstorm with the team members

Make an ordered list of most important user stories

In the PPT make sure that you present the most important activities in a logical order (not in detail)  make sure we have a global idea on how you are going the reach the result. 

# Assignment 6: Making team arrangements

For a project team to work together in an efficient and effective way it is extremely important to make team arrangements from the beginning. The team agreements are also included in the presentation on Thursday.  

This is not only important for the client/lecturers (so he can see that the team is well-organized and is up for the job), but also for the team members.  

Writing the agreements down on paper gives team members a way to control  themselves and others and gives them the opportunity to speak up when agreements are not kept.  It’s a lot more difficult to do so if there are no agreements made in advance.  

Make agreements with the group about the next questions: 

- 1° how will we communicate with each other (who, when, how and how often, tools/technology? …) ?

- 2° how will we hold meetings: who is the chairman and what are his tasks?  who is the note taker and what are his tasks?  Do we use a template for the agenda and minutes? How will we prepare for a meeting?  When will the notes of the meeting be available?  Until when can we post agenda items and to whom?  Will there be fixed agenda items?  How do we make sure the meeting is not to long?  How do we ask to speak on a meeting? …

- 3° how do we take decisions: every time the same way or different ways depending on the issue?  How do we make sure we won’t lose important time?  Who can decide what?  What is the role of the project manager? in making decisions? How will we file decisions to look back on later? …

- 4° When is everybody available to work on this project?  Do we always have to work together or can we work separate as well?  Do we always work in the school or in the organization?  When is it ok when somebody of the team is absent?  …

- 5° What are the agreements on working with digital tools for collaboration? What will we use and how , …

- 6° What agreements do we make around collaborating (ethics): respect? Trust?  Communicating? Loyalty towards the teams?  Involvement? Expertise? Responsibility? Honesty? …

- 7° What if the agreements aren’t honored? What are the penalties? …

# Assignment 7:  Presentation of the project proposal

1° Presentation of the project proposal

- the aim of the presentation is to inform the lecturers and the other students of your project
- You will give a PITCH (find online information how to give a good pitch)

- the aim is also to show how you understood the assignment and how you will execute it
 so it has to be clear to everybody (other students who don’t know the content of your project yet and the client who wants to know how you understood his assignment)

- the content of the presentation can be found in all previous assignments.

- you work with PowerPoint (or Prezi) and hold a presentation of 15 minutes.  Creativity is encouraged, but make sure you bring a clear story.

- after the presentation there is the opportunity to ask questions.
